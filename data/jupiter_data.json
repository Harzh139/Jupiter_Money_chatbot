NACHSICheque Bounce Charges These charges apply when a home loan payment fails due to insufficient funds in the linked account or if the account is closed.

Missing a payment can lower your credit score significantly and affect the credit score of someone who co-signed your loan application. Can Affect Transfer Eligibility Missed payments can make it harder to qualify for a balance transfer to a new lender with a lower interest rate. Non-Performing Asset NPA Status If you miss your first two loan payments, your lender will send reminders. If you havent made a payment in 90 days, your loan may be classified as a Non-Performing Asset NPA. Increased Costs for Subsequent EMI Payments Missing a home loan EMI can result in increased future payments due to added late fees and penalties. What Factors Affect Your Home Loan EMI? Loan Amount Principal The total sum you borrow for your home purchase. A larger loan amount translates to a higher EMI payment. Interest Rate The interest rate offered by the bank determines how much you pay in addition to the loan amount. A higher interest rate translates to a higher EMI. Processing Fee The processing fee covers the cost of reviewing your home loan application. Its usually a percentage of the loan amount or set as a fixed fee. Loan Tenure Longer loan tenures result in lower monthly EMIs but higher total interest paid over time. Shorter tenures lead to higher monthly EMIs but lower total interest.

The National Pension System NPS, previously known as National Pension Scheme, is an investment instrument offered by the Central Government. The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority PFRDA regulates the NPS, ensuring maximum security. You may invest in NPS regularly during your working years and create substantial wealth for retirement. Once you retire, a portion of the accumulated maturity amount will become available for withdrawal. And you will receive the rest as a monthly pension. Any Indian resident can invest in NPS. You can benefit from this pension scheme if you are a government, private or unorganized sector employee. But, before investing in NPS, you must learn how the scheme works. To understand this, use an NPS calculator online to get an idea about the returns the scheme can generate. The benefits of NPS NPS has become a popular investment avenue over the last few years due to its substantial returns and security. The scheme offers many other benefits that make it a suitable investment option for everyone. Here are five noteworthy advantages of NPS. High returns When investing to build a retirement fund, your focus should be to earn high returns. And NPS can offer that as it has historically provided 8 to 10 annual interest for more than a decade. When you invest in NPS, the fund managers put a portion of the money in equity-based investment options. That is how NPS generates higher returns than most other tax-saving schemes. Additionally, if you are not satisfied with the returns, the scheme allows you to change the fund manager as well. Stabilized risk Equity-linked investment products are generally risky as market volatility can affect their returns. But NPS is a safe option as the scheme systematically stabilizes the risk. If you are a government employee, NPS allows you to invest only up to 50 of your total fund in equities. The limit is between 50 and 70 for non-government employees. After you reach 50 years, the schemes equity exposure automatically starts to reduce by 2. If you are 60 years or more, the equity exposure limit will become fixed at 50. This systematic stabilization balances risk and returns, ensuring that your money is safe. If all these seem too complicated, you can use a National Pension Scheme calculator. It will quickly give you a maturity amount estimation without any hassles. Tax benefits One benefit of NPS that makes it lucrative is the tax deductions it offers. The contributions you and your employer make towards NPS are tax-deductible up to 1. The self-contributed amount is tax exemptible under subsection 80CCD 1 of Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. The deduction limit is 10 of your salary or 1. 5 lakhs, whichever is lower. The tax benefit for the employers contribution is covered under Section 80CCD 2. If you are self-employed, the tax deduction limit is 20 of your gross income under subsection 80CCD 1. But you will not get any exemption under Section 80CCD 2. Under Section 80CCD 2, the tax deduction limit is whichever is the lowest from the following. Employers NPS contribution Total gross income 10 of basic pay and Dearness Allowance DA Additionally, Section 80CCD 1B allows a tax deduction of up to 50,000 on your contribution to the NPS account. So, you can get a total tax exemption of up to 2 lakhs using the benefits offered by Sections 80CCD 1 and 80CCD 1B. Emergency withdrawal You may withdraw up to 60 of your accumulated NPS fund after the age of 60 years. You will get the remaining amount as pension paid on a regular basis from an insurance firm registered under PFRDA. Moreover, the withdrawn amount is tax-exempted. It is always advisable to stay invested in the NPS until you retire, allowing your money to grow into significant wealth. But NPS allows you to withdraw up to 25 of the fund for emergency purposes after staying invested for at least three years. The reasons for withdrawal can be medical treatment for yourself or your family, buying or building a house, higher education or wedding of children, and other purposes. You can withdraw the money three times during the investment tenure with a minimum gap of five years between each withdrawal. Equity allocation flexibility The Scheme E of NPS lets you invest up to 50 of the money in equity-based options. You may decide between active and auto choices for equity investments. If you select the former, you will have the freedom to decide how much to invest in equities within the set limit. The latter decides the equity contributions as per your age. The older you get, the lower will be the equity allocation, thereby reducing risk. The formula for calculating the NPS amount NPS offers compound interest like any other high-return investment product. You can use an NPS calculator to determine how much return you can expect from your investment within seconds. But, if you want to understand how the calculation works, it is important to learn the NPS formula, which uses multiple components A  Maturity amount P  Principal amount invested r  Annual interest rate n  Number of times the interest is compounded t  Tenure of investment Based on the above components, the formula is A  P x 1  rn n. t Let us understand the formula with the help of an example. Suppose you are presently 34 years old and decide to start contributing 3,000 a month to the NPS account. If you get an interest rate of 10 during the investment tenure of 26 years, the maturity amount will be 44. 35 lakhs for a total contribution of 9. Using an NPS return calculator, you can determine the expected profit based on your age and monthly investment. How to use the NPS calculator The NPS calculator is quick and easy to use with the following five steps. Mention the amount you wish to contribute under the How much do you want to invest per month? section. Adjust the slider under Your Current Age to input your age. Adjust the slider under What Is Your Expected Rate of Return? to input the interest rate of NPS. Adjust the slider under What Percent Do You Wish to Invest in Annuity? to mention the percentage of the total contribution you want to be invested in annuity. Adjust the slider under How Many Years Do You Wish to Invest? to provide the investment tenure. After you provide the details based on your requirements, the NPS pension calculator will show your total investment, lump-sum value, annuity value, and total maturity amount. Where to invest NPS vs. PPF Public Provident Fund PPF and NPS both are popular investment options in India, especially among people who want to build a substantial retirement fund. The choice depends on your investment goals and risk appetite. Both PPF and NPS offer a variety of benefits but also have fundamental differences. Below table shows a comparative analysis of both the options to help you make an informed decision. Criteria NPS PPF Rate of return Historically provided 8 to 10 interest. The current interest rate offered is 7. The government decides it quarterly. Lock-in period Until retirement 15 years Risk associated Minimum risk as the scheme controls it systematically. But NPS is linked to the market. So, it is not completely risk-free. No risk as the investment is not linked to the market. Tax benefits Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961 offers a tax deduction of up to  1. 5 lakhs on your contribution. Another  50,000 of tax deduction is available under Section 80CCD1B. You can get a tax deduction of up to  1. 5 lakhs on your investment under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. As you can see from the above information, NPS has the potential to offer higher maturity benefits. So, if you are willing to take a little risk, NPS will help you build a more sizable retirement fund than PPF. How does the NPS work? NPS has two stages accumulation and retirement. Accumulation  During this stage, NPS uses your contribution to accumulate funds by reinvesting the money in different options like debt instruments, equities, treasury bills, and government bonds. The growth continues until your retirement. Retirement  After retirement, you can withdraw up to 60 of the NPS fund. The remaining amount is used to invest in annuity plans that pay regular returns. FAQs related to the NPS calculator 1. Who can use the NPS calculator? Anyone eligible to invest in NPS can use the calculator. Presently, Indians between the age of 18 and 60 years can contribute to the scheme. If you belong to the group, the calculator will help you instantly get an idea about the potential returns.

Total investment Lump-sum value Annuity value Total maturity amount There are eight fund managers currently offering NPS in India.

The following month, the total contribution will become 2,350  2,350  4,700. You will also receive an interest of 4,700 x 0. The PF calculation uses the same formula for the subsequent months.

For the monthly calculation, the lowest amount recorded in your account from the 5th day of a month to the last day of that month is considered. Suppose your PPF balance on 1st April 2021 is 10,000, and you deposit another 30,000 on 3rd April 2021. In this scenario, the interest will be calculated on 40,000. But, if you deposit 30,000 on 6th April 2021, the interest will be calculated only on 10,000. Also, PPF offers compound interest on your balance. So, at the end of each year, the interest is calculated on your total balance principal amount and the interest already earned. Moreover, you may remain invested in the PPF after the lock-in period even without making additional deposits. You will still receive annually compounded returns on the balance amount.

Below is a list of the most common breakdown of the salary structure. Basic salary It is a part of the Cost to Company CTC that the employers pay to the employees for their services.

Section 105 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 offers tax exemption on the LTA amount for up to two holidays in a four-calendar-year block. You need to submit proof of travel to receive the tax benefit. Special Allowance This is a fixed amount your employer may pay above your basic salary. The Special Allowance varies among companies as it depends on multiple factors. Moreover, it is fully taxable. Bonus Bonus is a component of the gross salary that the employers may pay as a performance encouragement. The entire bonus amount is fully taxable. Employee Provident Fund EPF It is generally a mandatory savings scheme. You need to pay 12 of your basic salary as an EPF contribution. Moreover, your employer matches your contribution and invests the same amount in your EPF account. Your contribution is tax-deductible up to 1. 5 lakhs under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act , 1961.
